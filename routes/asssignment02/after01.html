      <p class="article-content">
        &emsp;This design philosophy can be integrated within either of the earlier concepts. Responsive Web Design (RWD) is simply
        dynamic rendering based on device size. Websites and applications that incorporate RWD principles have prepared for
        the end-user to be using anything from a desktop, to tablet, or smartphone. The most common implementation of RWD
        is through CSS media queries.
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries" target="_blank">@media</a> is a rule within CSS that changes or applies a look or layout when specified parameters are met such as
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/width" target="_blank">width</a>,
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/height" target="_blank">height</a>,
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/orientation" target="_blank">orientation</a>,
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/scripting" target="_blank">scripting</a>, etc.

        <br>
        <br>&emsp;In 2015, for the first time in history, users with mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) out-searched the
        web compared to users with desktops and laptops. Google embraced this turn with an update to it's search algorithm,
        coined "
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilegeddon" target="_blank">Mobilegeddon</a>
        ", that slightly favored websites which could return appealing layouts to mobile users. Searches from laptops and desktops
        were not affected. The resulting affect to traffic on non-responsive sites was fairly insubstantial, but could spell
        a trend in other markets as mobile performance increases and the desktop environment user-base shrinks.
